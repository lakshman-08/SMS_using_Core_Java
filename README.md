Problem Statement:-
Managing student records manually using registers or spreadsheets can be inefficient and
prone to errors. Teachers and administrators face challenges in tracking student attendance,
academic performance, and personal details effectively. A digital Student Management
System automates these processes, ensuring quick access to student data, better organization,
and improved accuracy in record-keeping.
